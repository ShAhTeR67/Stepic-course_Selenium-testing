# Stepic-course_Selenium-testing
This rep is for stepik course.
Starts by 'pytest --language= test_items.py'
<br>e.g. 'pytest --language=es test_items.py'
<br>Also could set up browser by adding '--browser_name='. Now available 2 browsers command: 'chrome' and 'firefox'.
<br>Both conftest and test_items files should be in the same folder. Make sure there are no other conftest files in this project.
